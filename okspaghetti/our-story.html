                    My Danish grandmother had a passion for cooking Italian food even though she never visited Italy even once in her long life. 
                    She passed this passion onto me. I spent much of my childhood over at Grandma’s eating her food, and eventually learning these same 
                    recipes that you can now enjoy.

                    After going to prison for digital piracy, I decided it was time to clean up my act and decided to try creating the next big phone game 
                    à la Flappy Bird. After this failed, I decided to go into a more reliable industry and started the restaurant that my grandmother had 
                    always dreamed of and OK! Spaghetti was born.
