      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I'd like to make a website for a fictional restaurant. The website's purpose is to give you information about the restaurant, the homepage will list it's location, 
         what kind of food the restaurant serves, as well as links to the child pages. It'll have a child page containing the menu, an "about us/our story" child page, and the site-plan page. 
      </p>  <!-- change this -->
      <p>
        Also I know that the color pallete is jarring, but that's the aesthetic I've decided to go with. Yellow like Spaghetti and 
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience is people who want to see information about the restaurant and order from the restaurant. So, it's quite a broad audience, 
         basically anyone with access to the internet could visit the website, as such it is important to make the website easy to use as it might be used by children
         or other people who aren't very tech-savvy. The audience will probably mostly use mobile devices so it will be important to build the website so it looks good 
         and functions on small screens as well as on laptops or desktop computers.

      <h3>Menu</h3>
      <p>
        Our Menu:
	      Welcome to the menu, here you will find all of our delicious meals, from our signature spaghetti all the way to kids’ meal items like chicken fingers. We hope that everything you are looking for! 
	      Entrées: 
        The OK! Spaghetti: The signature dish of our fine restaurant the recipe was passed down to from generation to generation (my grandmother’s generation to mine), if you don’t know what spaghetti is, google it you obviously have access to the internet if you have found this website.
        Chicken Scarpariello: Chicken sauteed in a tangly lemon glaze with bell pepper. This dish is cooked on the stove for hours to bring out the delicious Italian flavor. As such we might be out considering on when you order.
        Agnolotti del Plin: Tiny, meat filled Piedmontese agnolotti, stuffed with a pork, chicken, veal, and vegetable filling. Bound with butter and cheese.
        Pork Chop Milanese: A rib-cut pork chop dredged in flour, eggs, and seasoned with breadcrumbs before being fried. (the pork can be substituted with beef, or chicken).
        Ratatouille: Yes, it is the meal that the rat made. As my grandmother was wont to say, “French people are just rude Italians.”
        Fettuccine Alfredo: A pasta dish made with fettuccine, butter, and parmesan cheese. 
	      Soups:
		    Ribollita: A Tuscan bread soup, made with cannellini beans, laccarrot, beans, chard, celery, potatoes and onion.
		    Minestrone with White Beans and Italian Sausage: A thick soup made with white beans, onions, celery, carrots, leaf vegetables, and tomatoes, and pasta. 
		    Pappa al Pomodoro: This hearty tomato-bread soup starts with a whopping five pounds of fresh tomatoes. The tomatoes simmer with onion, crushed red pepper, and garlic. They then get thickened with cubes of Italian bread, and served with a drizzle of olive oil and a dollop of ricotta.
	      Kids Items:
		    Parmesan Chicken with Italian Fries (They’re like French fries but went through a fascist phase in the early/mid 20th century).
		    Chicken Fingers with Italian Fries: Comes with your choice of BBQ, Garlic Aioli, or Italian Cowboy dressing (it’s just ranch).
		    Pepperoni Pizza: While this item is on the Kids’ menu adults can order this too; however, you will be judged.

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Our Story:
	      My Danish grandmother had a passion for cooking Italian food even though she never visited Italy even once in her long life. She passed this passion onto me. I spent much of my childhood over at Grandma’s eating her food, and eventually learning these same recipes that you can now enjoy. 
	      After going to prison for digital piracy, I decided it was time to clean up my act and decided to try creating the next big phone game à la Flappy Bird. After this failed, I decided to go into a more reliable industry and started the restaurant that my grandmother had always dreamed of and OK! Spaghetti was born. 
	      We hope that our food will call back your own memories of family dinners just as they do for us.
